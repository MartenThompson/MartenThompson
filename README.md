## Welcome

I am PhD statistician and ML scientist who builds quantitative models from complex environmental, sensor, and operational data to understand and predict real-world systems.

I am most passionate about tackling problems around climate and the environment and have worked in blue tech (Sofar Ocean Technologies) and aerospace (NASA). 

Thanks for stopping by; please feel free to reach out to me by email if you'd like to talk about opportunites working on climate solutions. 

Happy trails.
